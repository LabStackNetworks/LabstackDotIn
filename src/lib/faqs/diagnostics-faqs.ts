    question: "How do you ensure phlebotomist quality and safety?",
    answer: "All phlebotomists are certified with minimum 2 years experience, background verified, and regularly trained on safety protocols. We maintain phlebo ratings by pincode and patient feedback (CSAT scores). Phlebotomists with below 4.2/5 rating or repeated complaints are blacklisted from specific areas. Real-time GPS tracking ensures accountability. PPE, sanitization, and infection control protocols are strictly followed across all locations including high-density areas in Mumbai (Dadar, Kurla), Delhi (Laxmi Nagar, Karol Bagh), Bangalore (Marathahalli, Jayanagar)."

For pediatric or geriatric patients requiring special care, we can arrange specialized phlebotomists in major cities."
  },
  
  // Quality & Compliance
  {
    question: "How do you ensure diagnostic quality across multiple labs?",
    answer: "We enforce 100% report verification before delivery, implement phlebo blacklisting by pincode based on patient feedback, use CSAT-based lab selection, provide digital raw values with smart reporting, and conduct regular quality audits of partner labs. All labs undergo quarterly proficiency testing and maintain CAP/NABL accreditation."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your labs NABL accredited?",
    answer: "Yes, all partner labs in our network are NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited and follow ISO 15189 standards for medical laboratories. Major partner labs are also CAP (College of American Pathologists) certified."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle report errors or discrepancies?",
    answer: "We have a multi-layer verification process. If any discrepancy is found, reports are held back for re-testing at no additional cost. We maintain less than 0.1% report error rate through automated delta checks, critical value alerts, and manual pathologist review. In case of errors, patients receive corrected reports within 24 hours and are personally contacted by our quality team."
  },
  {
    question: "How are raw digital values different from PDF reports?",
    answer: "Raw digital values are structured, machine-readable data (JSON/API format) that enable trend charts, longitudinal tracking, and clinical decision support. Unlike static PDFs, digital values allow comparison across time, integration with EMRs, automated flagging of abnormal results, and AI-powered health insights. Essential for chronic disease management, wellness programs, and data-driven care."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I harmonize test results across different labs?",
    answer: "Yes, we standardize test nomenclature and reference ranges across our network. When patients switch between labs or cities (e.g., Mumbai to Bangalore or Delhi to Pune), their historical results remain comparable. We use LOINC codes for test standardization and provide normalized reference ranges based on age, gender, and population demographics."
  },
  
  // Instant Booking & Reporting
  {
    question: "How fast can I book and get results?",
    answer: "Booking is instant through our API or white-label interface. Slots are available within 2-4 hours for home collection in metros and tier-2 cities. For standard pathology tests, results are delivered in 24-48 hours. Radiology reports: same day to 72 hours. Critical tests (troponin, blood culture) are processed on priority with results in 6-12 hours. Available across Bangalore (Indiranagar, Koramangala), Mumbai (Bandra, Juhu), Delhi (Vasant Kunj, Saket), and 600+ other cities."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer instant POC (point-of-care) testing at health camps?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide instant testing for blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, hemoglobin, blood pressure, BMI, and rapid antigen tests at health camps. Results are available on-site within 10-15 minutes. Advanced tests requiring lab processing are collected on-site and results shared digitally within 24-48 hours. Popular for corporate wellness camps across IT parks in Bangalore (Whitefield, Manyata Tech Park), Pune (Hinjewadi, Magarpatta), Hyderabad (Gachibowli, HITEC City), and NCR (Cyber City, Sector 62 Noida)."
  },

Real-time status tracking and automated escalations ensure SLA compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "How does billing and reconciliation work?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is your TAT (Turnaround Time) guarantee?",
    answer: "Standard pathology tests: 24-72 hours. Radiology: Same day to 72 hours. Genetic tests: 7-14 days. We provide SLA-backed guarantees with real-time tracking and automated escalations for delays. In case of SLA breaches, penalties apply as per contract terms. 99.2% on-time delivery rate across our network."
  },
  
  // For Digital Health Platforms
  {
    question: "Can I white-label the diagnostics experience?",
    answer: "Yes, diagnostics services are fully white-labelable. From booking interface to report delivery, everything carries your brand. We power the infrastructure invisibly. Your users see your brand across Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, and 600+ cities—we handle lab coordination, quality, logistics in the background."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide raw digital values or just PDF reports?",
    answer: "We provide both. Raw digital values are structured data (JSON via API) that enable trend charts, predictive analytics, and clinical decision support. PDFs are also available for printing and sharing. Digital values unlock longitudinal tracking, automated health scoring, and personalized insights."
  },
  
  // For Healthcare Providers
  {
    question: "Can I integrate diagnostics into my clinic workflow?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide EMR integration, e-prescription uploads, and automatic test ordering. Results flow back into your system automatically with patient matching via HL7/FHIR standards. Integrations available with major EMRs like Practo Ray, Lybrate, HealthPlix, and custom clinic management systems."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need specialized or rare tests?",
    answer: "Our network includes reference labs for specialized testing. If a test is not available in our network, we'll onboard the required lab within 2 weeks to fulfill the order. We have partnerships with advanced labs in Mumbai (SRL, Metropolis), Delhi (Dr. Lal PathLabs), Bangalore (Healthians), and international reference labs for ultra-rare tests."
  },
  
  // Pricing & Commercial
  {
    question: "How does pricing work?",
    answer: "Pricing is usage-based with tiered volume discounts. No setup fees or minimum commitments. Pay only for completed tests. Transparent per-test pricing with volume discounts at 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000+ tests/month. Custom enterprise pricing available for high-volume partners (insurers, large corporates, hospital chains)."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden charges?",
    answer: "No hidden charges. The price includes sample collection, testing, quality checks, report generation, and digital delivery. Home visit charges (₹50-150) may apply in select remote areas. Pricing is clearly mentioned at booking time. No surprise fees across any of our 9,000+ serviceable pincodes."
