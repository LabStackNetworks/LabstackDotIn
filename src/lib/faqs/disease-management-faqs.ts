  {
    question: "What chronic diseases can be managed through Labstack?",
    answer: "Diabetes, hypertension, cardiac care, cancer support, kidney disease, respiratory conditions, mental health programs, and custom disease-specific protocols. Tailored care pathways for each condition."
  },
  {
    question: "How do care pathways work?",
    answer: "Protocol-driven workflows: diagnostic tests trigger consultations, abnormal values auto-schedule follow-ups, prescriptions flow to pharmacy, reminders sent for medication adherence and lifestyle checks. Fully automated patient journey."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get structured health data instead of PDF reports?",
    answer: "Yes, raw digital values for every test parameter. Enables trend charts, longitudinal health tracking, automated clinical alerts, and integration with care management software. No more manual PDF parsing."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure patient adherence to care plans?",
    answer: "Automated reminders for tests, consultations, and medication refills. Follow-up nudges via SMS, email, and app notifications. Non-adherence triggers escalations to care managers. Gamification and incentives supported."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical patient engagement rate?",
    answer: "Care pathway completion rate >90%, patient churn <20%, and 2.5-3x increase in patient LTV compared to manual care programs. Automated follow-ups dramatically improve adherence."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize protocols for my disease management program?",
    answer: "Yes, fully customizable. Define test frequencies, consultation triggers based on values, medication protocols, escalation rules, and care team workflows. We implement your clinical SOPs into the platform."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle emergency situations flagged by test results?",
    answer: "Critical values trigger instant alerts to care managers and doctors. Auto-escalation protocols activate. Urgent consultation scheduled within hours. Notifications sent to patient and family. Full audit trail maintained."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support home-based care for chronic disease patients?",
    answer: "Yes, home sample collection for routine tests, home visits by nurses for vitals monitoring, physiotherapy at home, medication delivery, and tele-consultations. Complete home care infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "How does cross-service coordination work in care pathways?",
    answer: "Seamless handoffs: test results automatically shared with doctor, consultation generates e-Rx sent to pharmacy, medication delivered with adherence tracking, follow-up tests scheduled based on protocol. No manual coordination needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate Labstack with my care management software?",
    answer: "Yes, APIs for bidirectional data exchange. Push care plans to Labstack, receive service completion updates, sync health data, and trigger workflows. EMR integration and HL7/FHIR support available."
  },
  {
    question: "What metrics can I track for program effectiveness?",
    answer: "Patient adherence rates, care pathway completion, health outcome improvements (HbA1c reduction, BP control), hospitalization reduction, patient satisfaction (NPS), cost per patient, and program ROI."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure quality of doctors in disease-specific programs?",
    answer: "Specialty-specific credential verification, experience requirements (e.g., 5+ years for diabetes care), CSAT monitoring, patient outcome tracking, and continuous medical education. Underperformers removed from network."
