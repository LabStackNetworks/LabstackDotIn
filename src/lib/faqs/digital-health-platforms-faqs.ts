  {
    question: "How long does it take to integrate Labstack into our platform?",
    answer: "Developers can integrate in 2-4 hours using our SDKs and sandbox. Production deployment takes 24-48 hours including testing. Full white-label customization adds 1-2 weeks. Much faster than building in-house."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide embeddable widgets or just APIs?",
    answer: "Both. RESTful APIs for programmatic control, embeddable widgets for quick integration, and pre-built UI components for common workflows. Choose based on your development resources and timeline."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we use our own UI and call your APIs in the background?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Headless architecture. Our APIs handle fulfillment, your UI controls patient experience. Complete frontend flexibility. Common approach for platforms with established design systems."
  },
  {
    question: "What if we want to use our contracted providers alongside Labstack's network?",
    answer: "We can onboard your providers into our platform for unified operations or run parallel networks. Routing logic determines when to use your providers vs. ours. Seamless failover and load balancing."
  },
  {
    question: "How does white-labeling work?",
    answer: "Your brand on all patient touchpoints: booking confirmations, sample collection, reports, consultations, and delivery. Labstack completely invisible. Custom domains, branded emails, and co-branded apps supported."
  },
  {
    question: "What is API uptime and what happens during downtime?",
    answer: "99.5% uptime SLA. Redundant systems with automatic failover. Queued requests processed when systems recover. Real-time status page and incident notifications. SLA credits applied for downtime."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we handle customer support ourselves or do you manage it?",
    answer: "Your choice. Use our customer support team or handle it in-house. We provide ops console for your team to manage bookings, exceptions, and tracking. Training and playbooks provided."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle data privacy and security?",
    answer: "Healthcare-grade encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, audit logs, HIPAA-equivalent practices, regular security audits, and compliance with Indian data protection regulations. SOC 2 Type II in progress."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support international expansion outside India?",
    answer: "Currently focused on India. Building capabilities for South Asia and Middle East expansion in 2024. Priority markets: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Early access available for design partners."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing scale as we grow?",
    answer: "Usage-based with volume discounts. No setup fees or minimum commitments. As volume grows, unit costs decrease. Predictable pricing model. Enterprise tiers with committed volumes get preferential rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What SDKs and programming languages do you support?",
    answer: "Official SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, PHP, and Java. Community SDKs for other languages. All open-sourced on GitHub. RESTful APIs work with any language. Postman collections available."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we run pilots in select cities before full rollout?",
    answer: "Yes, phased rollouts supported. Start with 2-3 pilot cities, validate operations and unit economics, then expand nationwide. Geo-based controls available via API. Common approach for risk mitigation."
