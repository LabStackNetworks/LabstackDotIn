    question: "Can I launch in select cities first and expand later?",
    answer: "Yes, phased geographic rollout supported. Start with metros, add Tier-2 next quarter, then Tier-3. Control which cities are active via API. Validate unit economics before full expansion."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing differ between metros and smaller cities?",

    question: "What happens if no provider is available in a patient's pincode?",

    answer: "Yes, city-wise performance dashboards: CSAT scores, SLA adherence, complaint rates, turnaround times, and cost metrics. Identify problem areas and take corrective action. Alerts for quality issues."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my customers are spread across rural areas?",
    answer: "We cover 9,000+ pincodes including semi-rural areas. For truly remote locations, hub-and-spoke model: patient travels to nearest collection point or we arrange periodic health camps. Flexible solutions based on demand density."

    answer: "We partner with quality local players, bringing them national business and operational systems. Not competing—enabling. Local providers get steady B2B demand, we get geographic reach. Win-win."
  },
