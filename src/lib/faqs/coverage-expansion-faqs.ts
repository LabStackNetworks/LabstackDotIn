    question: "Can I track service quality separately for each city?",
    answer: "Yes, city-wise performance dashboards: CSAT scores, SLA adherence, complaint rates, turnaround times, and cost metrics. Identify problem areas and take corrective action. Alerts for quality issues."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my customers are spread across rural areas?",
    answer: "We cover 9,000+ pincodes including semi-rural areas. For truly remote locations, hub-and-spoke model: patient travels to nearest collection point or we arrange periodic health camps. Flexible solutions based on demand density."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you compete with local players in smaller cities?",
    answer: "We partner with quality local players, bringing them national B2B demand and operational systems. Enables geographic expansion from metro-to-Tier-3 through partnerships, not competition."
  },
