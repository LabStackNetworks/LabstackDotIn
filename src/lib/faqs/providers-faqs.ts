    question: "How does joining Labstack increase my revenue?",
    answer: "Steady B2B demand from insurers, corporates, and healthtech platforms fills idle capacity. Utilization increases from typical 40-50% to 60-70%. Revenue doubles, margins improve 15-25% through better asset utilization."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the onboarding process for providers?",
    answer: "Submit credentials and licenses, verification in 3-5 days, training on platform and quality standards, technical integration (if needed), test orders, and go live. Account manager assigned throughout. Typically completed in 1-2 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly do I receive payments?",
    answer: "15-day payment terms. Automated reconciliation, transparent invoicing, direct bank transfers. No 60-90 day cycles like traditional aggregators. Predictable cash flow for your business."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to invest in technology or software?",
    answer: "Minimal tech requirements. Use our web console for order management or integrate with your existing LIS/RIS/pharmacy software via APIs. Mobile app for phlebotomists and delivery staff. No major IT investments needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I continue working with my existing clients and platforms?",
    answer: "Yes, non-exclusive partnership. Continue all existing relationships. Labstack provides incremental volume to fill capacity gaps. No lock-in or exclusivity required."
  },
  {
    question: "What quality standards do I need to maintain?",
    answer: "Service-specific standards: NABL/CAP accreditation for labs, valid licenses for pharmacies, MCI registration for doctors. Continuous CSAT monitoring, SLA adherence tracking, and regular quality audits."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I cannot fulfill an order?",
    answer: "Notify us immediately via console. We'll assign alternate provider to avoid customer impact. No penalty if reasons are genuine (equipment breakdown, staff shortage). Repeated failures affect your ranking in network."
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work? Can I negotiate rates?",
    answer: "Transparent rate cards per service type and geography. Competitive with market rates. Volume-based pricing—higher volumes get better rates. Annual rate reviews. Initial rates negotiable during onboarding based on capabilities."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide marketing to drive direct B2C demand to my center?",
    answer: "No, Labstack is pure B2B infrastructure. Orders come from our enterprise clients (insurers, corporates, healthtech). You fulfill orders without needing your own B2C marketing. Consistent demand without customer acquisition costs."
  },
  {
    question: "What support do you provide for operational issues?",
    answer: "Dedicated partner success manager, 24/7 support for urgent issues, training for staff on platform and workflows, technical integration assistance, and regular business reviews. Partner portal with resources and FAQs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set capacity limits or blackout dates?",
    answer: "Yes, manage your availability via console. Set daily capacity limits, block dates for holidays or maintenance, adjust working hours, and prioritize order types. Full control over what orders you accept."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure I get quality orders and not just low-margin business?",
    answer: "Mix of B2B enterprise orders (higher volumes, stable demand), premium health packages, and specialized tests. Pricing designed to be profitable. No race-to-bottom pricing. Focus on sustainable partnerships, not just volume."
