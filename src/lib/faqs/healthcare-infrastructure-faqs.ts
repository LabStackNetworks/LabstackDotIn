  {
    question: "What does healthcare infrastructure include?",
    answer: "Complete infrastructure for diagnostics (pathology, radiology, genetic tests), consultations (tele + in-clinic), pharmacy delivery, and specialized services (ambulance, dental, physiotherapy, home care) across 9,000+ pincodes."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from aggregators?",
    answer: "We provide deep integration, not just aggregation. You get unified billing, operations automation, quality enforcement, digital health data, and SLA-backed fulfillment. Aggregators just connect you to vendors."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I launch with partial infrastructure?",
    answer: "Yes, start with one service (diagnostics, consultations, or pharmacy) and expand. Each service is modular and independently deployable."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the implementation timeline?",
    answer: "14 days for basic integration. 3-4 weeks for full white-label deployment with complex custom workflows and enterprise system integrations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide operations support?",
    answer: "Yes, we handle provider onboarding, SLA monitoring, exception management, quality audits, and customer support. You can use our ops team or build your own."
  },
  {
    question: "How does quality control work across services?",
    answer: "Service-specific quality frameworks: lab accreditation for diagnostics, doctor credentials for consultations, license verification for pharmacies. Continuous CSAT monitoring and blacklisting underperformers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize pricing for my customers?",
    answer: "Yes, you control customer pricing. We provide cost prices, you add your markup. Dynamic pricing, promotional codes, and subscription models supported."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a service fails (e.g., missed sample collection)?",
    answer: "Automated escalations, alternate provider assignment, and resolution within SLA. You get real-time alerts and can track resolution through console. Refunds processed if unresolved."
  },
  {
    question: "How do cross-service workflows work?",
    answer: "Seamless handoffs: consultation to diagnostic order to pharmacy fulfillment to follow-up. Patient data flows automatically across services with unified tracking."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support disease-specific care programs?",
    answer: "Yes, we build custom protocols for diabetes care, cardiac programs, cancer support, etc. with specialized provider networks, SOPs, and compliance frameworks."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your uptime guarantee?",
    answer: "99.9% platform uptime SLA. Redundant systems, automated failover, and real-time monitoring ensure continuous availability."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I migrate from my current provider?",
    answer: "Phased migration with parallel running. We handle data migration, provider mapping, and patient communication. Zero downtime migration possible."
